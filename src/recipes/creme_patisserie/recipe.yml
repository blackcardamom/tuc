  I have tried to make an alternative to the baking classic, thatâ€™s just as versatile.
  This is my version of creme patisserie.
  I think the key is good vanilla to provide the richness, but you may choose any custard powder you want.

ingredients:
  - 250g double cream
  - 100g white chocolate
  - 2tbsp custard powder
  - 220ml whole milk
method:
  - Make the custard. Mix the custard powder in a bowl with 2tbsp milk, to make a thick paste. Gently heat the rest of the milk in a pan, until just under boiling. Mix the custard together and place back in the pan. With a whisk, stir the custard mix over the heat until you have a thick custard. Cover and leave to cool completely.
  - In a separate bowl, melt the white chocolate. You can either do this over a bain marie, or just in the microwave keeping an eye on it. Leave to cool completely.
  - Whip the cream until just after soft peaks form. Mix together the custard and white chocolate in a bowl, and then fold in the whipped cream until you have a light, fluffy mixture.
  - You are ready to use this in other recipes.
